In the present project the Simulated Annealing metaheuristic it is applied to optimize profile sections of simple steel truss structures. The problem itâ€™s represented by using an objective function without penalization, restrictions regarding maximum stress and maximum strain on members and nodes of the truss structure respectively. The metaheuristics it is compared against the test set published by the International Student Competition in Structural Optimization (ISCSO) 2015.
